# SkeletalSimilarityMetric
A MATLAB implementation of the skeletal similarity metric for quality evaluation of vessel segmentation. If you find the metrics useful, please cite the upcoming paper

"A skeletal similarity metric for quality evaluation of retinal vessel segmentation" by Z. Yan, X. Yang, and K. -T. Cheng.

SkeletalSimilarity.m is the main function of the calculation of skeletal similarity.

Run Example.m to compare the skeletal similarity metric with the traditional evaluation metrics Se, Sp and Acc.
